# TextProcessor
A text processor which performs certain operations on strings is developed using lex and yacc.
LEX and Yacc are used to achieve the following tasks.
This is similar to Calculator, except it is used with text strings.
Text processor â€‹: Let op1 and op2 are operands whose values are text (contains alphanumeric characters).
op1 * op2 is a concatenation of the two operands.
op1~op2 is true if op1 is a prefix of op2 (Eg: abc ~ abcd has the value true).
op1@op2 is true if op1 is a suffix of op2
op1#op2 is true if op1 is a substring of op2
op1 = op2 is true if both operands are equal.
op1 <> op2 is true if op1 is not equal to op2.
op1^numb, where numb is a non-negative integer is, op1 concatenated to itself numb number of times.
op1%numb is the prefix of op1 whose length is numb.
op1&numb is the suffix of op1 whose length is numb.
?op1 gives the length of op1.
Operations can be nested using braces ( ).
Precedence & associativity rules
Highest to lowest precedence, the operators are: (),?,^.*, %,&,~,@,#,=
Associativity is from left to right (except for ? and ^ which are right to left).
An appropriate CFG for this and used.
Example:
Input: abc^2 ===> Output: abcabc
Input: abc^?xyz ===> Output: abcabcabc
concatenate%6&3 ===> cat
concatenate%6&3 = cat ===> true
